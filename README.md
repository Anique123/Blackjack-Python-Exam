# Blackjack-Python-Exam

The project is a simple Blackjack game where it is possible to play both as a Player and a Dealer. it is possible to bet and double the stake. You have to start a new round everytime so your win/loss are not saved. You can in the menu choose to play as a player or a dealer by entering "1" or "2". Then you get to the gamemenu where the navigation buttons again are "1" or "2".
The application file can be downloaded and started as a normal python file. You start the application by writing "python3 Blackjack.py" in the terminal. As mentioned earlier you have to restart the application everytime you want to play a new round of blackjack. The dealer cant hit when getting 17 within first 2 cards - as the rules are in a normal casino.
